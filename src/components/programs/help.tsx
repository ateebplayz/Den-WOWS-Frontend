        operating system!</strong> to open a program <strong>click</strong> on the icon and to close it click on the x
        on the top right. you can also open <strong>multiple</strong> programs and you can resize windows
        by <strong>dragging</strong> the edges. you can also <strong>position</strong> each window individually
        by <strong>dragging</strong> the heading (where the program name is at).</p>
      <p className={'text-light text-center w-full mt-4 text-sm'}>every so often a notification will pop up in
        the <strong>updates</strong> tab on the right. this indicates there is a new breaking headline. open
        the <strong>news</strong> application to check out this headline. based on the headline analyse which stocks
        will tank or go up, and based on your judgement purchase/sell those stocks using
        the <strong>stocks</strong> application. pretty simple right?</p>

        your money, like a mini bank statement, or to take a loan open the <strong>bank</strong> application. please
        note this can tank your final scoring based on the loan you take.</p>
      <p className={'text-light text-center w-full mt-4 text-sm'}>lastly, if you&lsquo;re curious about who the team
        behind this category is, use the <strong>credits</strong> application. to get a general overview use
